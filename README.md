## How it works

After cloning this repo to your machine, run the server by entering "npm start" in your terminal. Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Visit the following paths to see the HTTP server at work, or choose your own name and salutation:

localhost:3000/greeting
localhost:3000/greeting?salutation=howdy
localhost:3000/greeting/erik?salutation=buenos+dias

localhost:3000/fact

localhost:3000/bad
